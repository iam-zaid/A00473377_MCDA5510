This is the solution for Assignment on Asp.net.
Below points have been considered for the assignment:
1. For checking the invalid row, the validations used are checking each field for null and empty values.
2. For logging, I have used the Serilog package library and handling exception in thr catch block as well noting the path and line of error for invalid row.
3. I have used the CSVHelper library to read the csv files.
4. Added comments at various places to understand as well explain the code logic.
